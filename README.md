Sample project that utilizes new Spring Webflux framework but bootstraps spring manually without Spring boot.

It mixes pure Java and Kotlin development. But as I am novice with Kotlin, the bootstrap code and route declaration
is written mostly in Java.

In this project I tries few things with webflux:
 * customization of Jackson object mapper
 * integration with Zalando problem library
 * specifying routes in functional mode
 
What is left:
 * integration with OpenAPI/Swagger
 * writing unit and integration tests
